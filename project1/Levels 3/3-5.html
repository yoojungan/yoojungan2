		The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost<br/>
		<br/><br/>
		</p>
		</div>
		<p>
Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br/>
And sorry I could not travel both<br/>
And be one traveler, long I stood<br/>
And looked down one as far as I could<br/>
To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br/>
		</p>
		<p>
Then took the other, as just as fair,<br/>
And having perhaps the better claim,<br/>
Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br/>
Though as for that the passing there<br/>
Had worn them really about the same,<br/>
		</p>
		<p>
And both that morning equally lay<br/>
In leaves no step had trodden black.<br/>
Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br/>
Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br/>
I doubted if I should ever come back.<br/>
		</p>
		<div>
		<p>
I shall be telling this with a sigh<br/>
Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br/>
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-<br/>
I took the one less traveled by,<br/>
