		<h1><a href="www.facebook.com">The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost</h1></a>
		<h2><div> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,</div>
		<div>And <em>sorry</em></div> 
		<div><a href="www.facebook.com"><strong>I</strong></a> could not travel both</div>
		<div>And be one traveler, long <a href="www.facebook.com"><strong>I</strong></a> stood</div>
		<div>And looked down one as far as <a href="www.facebook.com"><strong>I</strong></a> could</div>
		<div>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</div><div></div>
		<div>Then took the other, as just as fair,</div>
		<div>And having perhaps the better claim,</div>
		<div>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</div>
		<div>Though as for that the passing there</div>
		<div>Had worn them really about the same,</div>
		<div>And both that morning equally lay</div>
		<div>In leaves no step had trodden black.</div>
		<div>Oh, <a href="www.facebook.com"><strong>I</strong></a> kept the first for another day!</div>
		<div>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</div>
		<div><a href="www.facebook.com"><strong>I</strong></a> doubted if <a href="www.facebook.com"><strong>I</strong></a> should ever come back.</div>
		<div><a href="www.facebook.com"><strong>I</strong></a> shall be telling this with a sigh</div>
		<div>Somewhere ages and ages hence:</div>
		<div>Two roads diverged in a wood, and <a href="www.facebook.com"><strong>I</strong></a></div></h2>
