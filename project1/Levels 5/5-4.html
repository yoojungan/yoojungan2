		<em>The Road Not Taken by Robert Frost</em></a>

						<strong>Two</strong> roads diverged in a yellow wood, And sorry

		<ol>
		<li>
		I could not travel both
		<li>
		And be one traveler, long I stood
		<li>
		And looked down one as far as I could
		<li>
		To where it bent in the undergrowth;
		</li>

			<h2><div><lu><li><strong>Then</strong> took the other, as just as fair,</li></lu></div></a></h2>
			<ol>
			<li>
			And having perhaps the better claim,
			<li>
			Because it was grassy and wanted wear;
			<li>Though as for that the passing there
			<li>Had worn them really about the same,

		<ol>
		<li>
		In leaves no step had trodden black.
		<li>Oh, I kept the first for another day!
		<li>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,
		<li>I doubted if I should ever come back.

		Somewhere ages and ages hence:
		<li>
		Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-
		<li>
		I took the one less traveled by,
		<li>
		And that has made all the difference.
